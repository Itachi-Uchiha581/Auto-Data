# **Auto Data** ðŸ“œ
> Auto Data is **the** library designed for the automatic generation of realistic datasets, essential for the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). This highly efficient and **lightweight** library enables the swift and effortless creation of comprehensive **datasets** across various topics, regardless of their size.

## Why Auto Data?
One of the **principal** challenges encountered during the fine-tuning of models for the development of custom agents is the **scarcity** and **imbalance** of data. Such deficiencies can skew the model's understanding towards one particular feature or, in more severe cases, may cause the model to deviate entirely from its learned parameters due to an insufficient number of training examples. To address these critical issues, Auto Data was developed.

## **Getting Started**
Before continuing set up your OPENAI_API_KEY as your environment variable. If you are unaware on how to do so, refer to this guide - https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety
1. ### **Installation:** 
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Itachi-Uchiha581/Auto-Data.git
    ```

2. ### **Usage Through CLI:**
    ```shell
    cd Auto-Data
    ```
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    ```shell
    python main.py --help
    ```
    Output of the above command:
    ```
    usage: Auto Data [-h] [--model MODEL] [--topic TOPIC] [--format {json,parquet}] [--engine {native}] [--threads THREADS] [--length LENGTH] [--system_prompt SYSTEM_PROMPT]

    Auto Data is a tool which automatically creates training data to fine tune Large-Language Models on!

    options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --model MODEL, -m MODEL
                            Selection of an OpenAI model for data generation
    --topic TOPIC, -t TOPIC
                            Topic for data generation, eg - Global Economy
    --format {json,parquet}, -f {json,parquet}
                            The format of the output data produced by the LLM
    --engine {native}, -e {native}
                            The backend used to generate data. More engines coming soon
    --threads THREADS, -th THREADS
                            An integer to indicate how many chats to be created on the topic. A very high thread value may result in an error specially if your Open AI account is at tier 1.
    --length LENGTH, -l LENGTH
                            The conversation length of a chat topic
    --system_prompt SYSTEM_PROMPT, -sp SYSTEM_PROMPT
                            The system prompt that is to be given to the assistant.

    ```
    Sample Usage given below
    ```shell
    python main.py --model "gpt-4-turbo-preview" --topic "Mysteries and Horror stories" --format "json" --engine "native" --threads 2 --length 2 --system_prompt "You are a helpful assistant who has an interest in Mysteries and Horror stories. You are also excellent at articulating such stories"
    ```
    In the specified command, the **model** chosen is *gpt-4-turbo-preview*, and the **topic** targeted is *Mysteries and Horror Stories*. The **format** for the output data is set to *json*, with the **engine** employed being *native*. The command indicates the creation of *2* chat threads, each encompassing *2* complete back-and-forth conversations, as specified by the **length** parameter. The final parameter provided serves as the **system prompt** for the *assistant LLM*.  
      
    Below is the trimmed output generated from the above command in *json* format:
    ```json

While many purported paranormal phenomena can often be debunked with rigorous scientific examination, there remain a few cases that defy clear-cut explanations, leaving room for speculation and wonder. Here are a few notable examples:\n\n### 1. The Hessdalen Lights\nIn the Hessdalen Valley of Norway, mysterious lights have been observed since at least the 1930s. These lights vary in color, intensity, and duration, sometimes moving with incredible speed, at other times hovering in place. Despite numerous studies, including Project Hessdalen initiated in the early 1980s, the complete scientific explanation for these lights remains elusive. Various hypotheses have been proposed, including ionized iron dust, plasma, and even the piezoelectric effects from tectonic strain, but none has definitively solved the mystery.\n\n### 2. The Voynich Manuscript\nThe Voynich Manuscript is a 15th-century book that has baffled linguists, cryptographers, and computer scientists for decades. Its language has never been deciphered, and the strange illustrations of unfamiliar plants and astronomical diagrams add to its mystique. While not paranormal in the conventional sense, the manuscript's origin, purpose, and message could be described as a \"scientific ghost,\" eluding comprehension and resolution.\n\n### 3. ............."
